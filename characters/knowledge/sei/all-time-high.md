# All-Time-High Introduction

**What is ALL-TIME-HIGH?**\
ALL-TIME-HIGH is a platform designed to transform consumption into contribution through a structured and gamified vaping experience. By combining traditional vaping with blockchain technology, we offer a transparent and accountable system that encourages ownership, participation, and rewards. All-time high ensure that every device, every puff, and every action is anchored in real value, bridging physical products with on-chain identity and token incentives.

**How It Works:**

- **Good Vibe Vape:** Users purchased NFT and receive one Good Vibe Vape. This allows users to start participating in the ecosystem using our patented hardware.
- **NFT Mining Pass:** Each vape comes with a unique, tradable NFT minted at the time of purchase. This NFT acts as a mining pass, tied to the user’s on-chain identity, and unlocks daily $HIGH token emissions.&#x20;
- **Token Emissions:** Once activated, the NFT begins emitting $HIGH tokens daily over a set emission cycle. These emissions are the core of the ecosystem, rewarding users for their participation and presence.

**The Future of Play, Evolved:**

- **Puff-to-Proof System:** All vaping activity and earned rewards will recorded on-chain, giving users a transparent and secure record of their progress. This data is self-custodial, meaning users maintain full control over their information.
- **Social Puff Circles:** Users allowed to form or join _“Puff Circles”_ (like squads or pods). The more members actively puff (with real device activity), the more bonus emissions each member receives. Boost together, vibe together.
- **Data Monetization System:** For users who choose to opt in, ALL-TIME-HIGH devices can passively capture anonymized usage patterns (such as puff frequency and airflow behavior) and share them with trusted partners. This allows member to monetize their real-world activity and earn additional rewards, turning everyday sessions into valuable on-chain signals. All data remains self-custodial and under user control, creating a system where lifestyle habits can generate real economic value.&#x20;

# The Stoned Sloth NFTs

Upon purchasing the ALL-TIME-HIGH bundle, users receive an NFT Pass —a digital mystery pack embedded with token emission utility. Once opened, it reveals your Mining Pass NFT, randomly assigned one of four rarities: Common, Rare, Epic, or Legendary.

Each rarity determines the amount of $HIGH tokens the NFT can emit daily. These NFTs are fully tradable, verifiable on-chain, and form the core of your identity and reward journey within the ecosystem.

# The $HIGH Token

The $HIGH token is deeply integrated with our Vape-to-Earn ecosystem, which rewards users for mindful vaping habits rather than frequent or excessive usage. There are two primary ways to acquire $HIGH tokens:

1. Hold an NFT Pass and Receive Token Emissions
2. Purchase in upon TGE

---

**Utility:**\
<sub>1. Payments with Benefits</sub>

Use $HIGH to:

- Restock pods & vapes
- Unlock exclusive product drops
- Access gated content & IRL perks

While fiat is accepted, $HIGH holders always get it better — with discounts, priority access, and loyalty-based boosts.

---

#### <sub>2. Vape-Linked Rewards</sub>

Every smart puff device acts as your on-chain identity.\
By syncing your activity, you earn $HIGH emissions over time, the cleaner your usage, the more consistent your flow.

This is Proof-of-Burn, not Proof-of-Waste.

#### <sub>3. Health Data Monetization (DePIN Mechanic)</sub>

Each device acts as a passive data signal node. With user consent, it captures anonymized usage patterns, like airflow behavior and frequency to form a new class of behavioral health data tied to daily rituals.

This data holds value. By opting in, users can choose to share these anonymized signals with verified third parties, including wellness brands, research institutions, or health-focused product companies and receive $HIGH in return.

At the same time, vape and wellness brands are often blocked from running paid ads on mainstream platforms. This means they have little to no access to direct consumer insights. With ATH, these brands can tap into aggregated, opt-in behavioral data while respecting user privacy and ownership.

Users own the signal. They choose when and how to share. And they earn when they do.

The ALL-TIME-HIGH ecosystem introduces a real-world-to-crypto earning loop,
powered by your NFT, your device, and your activity. Here's how it works —
phase by phase.

# Earning Model - Phase 1

### Phase 1: NFT-Linked Emissions

During Phase 1, you can start earning $HIGH tokens simply by holding the NFT Pass.

#### What You Need:

- 1x ALL-TIME-HIGH NFT Pass (minted on Sei)
- A connected Sei wallet to receive emissions

#### How You Earn:

- Each NFT Pass generates daily $HIGH emissions based on your NFT rarity.
- Rewards are distributed directly to the holder's wallet
- The earlier you mint and hold, the more you accumulate over time

This is your head start before the full Vape-to-Earn system launches. **Additional details on the mining-based earning mechanics will be released before the NFT sale concludes.**

# Tokenomics

- Token Symbol: HIGH
- Total Supply: 1 billion tokens
- Inflation Mechanism: Non-inflationary with multiple burn mechanisms
- Blockchain: SEI

The final tokenomics & halving rules will be released before the TGE.

# Roadmap

ALL-TIME-HIGH is building a long-term ecosystem that bridges culture, hardware, and tokenized participation.

Our journey starts by establishing the foundation: a strong community, native NFT infrastructure on Sei, and a token economy designed for sustainable emissions and early utility. From there, we move into integrating smart devices and on-chain behavior, designed to scale with community engagement and real adoption.
