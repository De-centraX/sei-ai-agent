# PoW2 (Proof of Web2)

The concept of **Proof of Web2 (PoW2)** is central to Archer Hunter’s growth strategy. It is our framework for bridging Web2 gaming’s massive player base into Web3 through verifiable, performance-driven participation.

Unlike many Web3 projects that rely solely on token incentives to attract early adopters, PoW2 focuses on:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Onboarding through familiar Web2 channels**

App stores, social media platforms, and influencer marketing, to reach players where they already are.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Tracking and rewarding meaningful in-game activity**

Engagement, progression, and community contributions, before introducing blockchain elements.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Verifying Web2 achievements on-chain**

Converting player progress and proof of skill into verifiable blockchain records, unlocking NFT rewards, governance rights, and token incentives.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

This method ensures that the Archer Hunter player base is **organic, active, and retention-focused** from day one, rather than speculative. It also allows us to leverage existing Web2 acquisition methods while gradually transitioning players into the Web3 ecosystem, minimizing friction and maximizing trust.

# THE CONTEXT

The gaming industry is experiencing a paradigm shift. Over the past two decades, the evolution from single-player offline titles to globally connected multiplayer experiences has been driven by advancements in internet infrastructure, mobile computing, and social platforms. However, in recent years, the introduction of blockchain technology, digital ownership, and decentralized economies has added a new layer of potential, one that redefines how games are played, monetized, and sustained.

Archer Hunter emerges at the intersection of three major forces shaping the future of gaming:

1. **The enduring dominance of Web2 gaming experiences** in terms of accessibility, mass adoption, and monetization strategies.
2. **The innovation of Web3 technologies** that introduce verifiable ownership, transparent economies, and permissionless interoperability.
3. **The growing player demand for meaningful, long-term engagement**, beyond short-lived trend cycles and exploitative monetization models.

### The Web2–Web3 Gap

Despite the explosive narrative around blockchain gaming, the industry has yet to truly capture the mainstream gaming audience. A large portion of Web3 games have failed to deliver compelling gameplay, focusing instead on speculative Tokenomics or short-term hype cycles. Conversely, Web2 titles remain unmatched in their polish, player retention, and broad accessibility, yet they lack the structural ability to offer players _true_ ownership or cross-platform economic freedom.

Archer Hunter’s design philosophy is rooted in bridging this gap. Rather than replacing the successful engagement models of Web2, we leverage them as a proven foundation — then enhance them with Web3 mechanics to create an ecosystem where both gameplay and digital economies thrive side-by-side. This approach is defined in our [pow2-proof-of-web2](introduction/pow2-proof-of-web2 'mention') model, which validates game quality and scalability by first achieving sustainable traction in a Web2 environment before layering in Web3 features.

### Market Landscape

The action RPG (ARPG) segment, Archer Hunter’s core genre, continues to demonstrate strong global performance. According to market reports:

- ARPGs account for a significant portion of mobile game revenue, driven by high replayability, competitive elements, and progression-based reward systems.
- In emerging markets, ARPG mobile titles have built massive player bases with low acquisition costs and strong word-of-mouth virality.
- Global player spending in mobile ARPGs is projected to grow steadily, with Asia-Pacific regions leading adoption.

Simultaneously, blockchain adoption in gaming is accelerating:

- The total market capitalization of Web3 Game projects has exceeded billions of USD, with year-over-year growth driven by both new game launches and infrastructure investment.
- Partnerships between traditional gaming studios and blockchain networks are becoming more common, signaling a shift toward hybrid models.
- Player expectations for asset portability and cross-game utility are steadily increasing.

Archer Hunter positions itself as a first-mover in combining these trends, building an ARPG with mass-market appeal that integrates a sustainable, player-owned economy.

### Why Now?

The timing for Archer Hunter’s entry into the hybrid Web2–Web3 gaming space is critical:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Blockchain infrastructure maturity**

Layer-1 and Layer-2 networks now provide the scalability, speed, and cost efficiency required for real-time gaming.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Improved onboarding experiences**

Modern wallet solutions and fiat on-ramps have reduced the friction for mainstream players to access blockchain-based features.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Post-hype market environment**

Following the early speculative wave of blockchain gaming, there is a clear industry shift toward games with real utility, retention, and quality that exactly the space Archer Hunter is positioned to dominate.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
