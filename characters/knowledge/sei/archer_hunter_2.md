### **Core Combat System**

The combat system is the foundation upon which _Archer Hunter_ is built. Drawing inspiration from classic roguelike and action-RPG games, the player controls a single hero using intuitive movement controls (virtual joystick or swipe navigation) combined with an auto-attack mechanism that triggers when standing still. This ensures fluid, skill-based dodging and positioning while maintaining the game’s accessibility for mobile users.

- **Projectile Physics:** Each shot fired has a defined trajectory, speed, and hitbox, introducing skill elements such as leading targets and positioning to maximize impact.
- **Enemy AI Behaviors:** Enemy units exhibit varied movement and attack patterns, from slow, heavily armored brutes to fast, evasive assassins, requiring players to adapt tactics dynamically.
- **Environmental Hazards:** Obstacles, traps, and destructible objects create emergent gameplay opportunities, allowing skilled players to manipulate terrain for advantage.

### **Progression and Leveling**

Progression is designed to provide both short-term gratification and long-term goals.

- **Session-Based Level-Ups:** Within each run or stage, players gain experience points (XP) from defeating enemies. Every level-up presents a choice of temporary upgrades — such as increased attack speed, expanded projectile spread, or elemental effects — that last for the duration of the session.
- **Persistent Hero Growth:** Outside of sessions, players can invest resources into permanent hero upgrades, unlocking new abilities, stats, and talents that redefine playstyle.
- **Skill Tree Specialization:** Each hero class features a branching skill tree with multiple viable builds, encouraging experimentation and strategic planning.

### **Loot and Itemization**

A compelling loot system fuels replayability by introducing variety and aspirational goals.

- **Randomized Drops:** Weapons, armor, and accessories have randomized stat rolls and rarities, creating unique combinations that can dramatically alter gameplay.
- **Set Bonuses:** Certain gear sets grant powerful bonuses when worn together, incentivizing players to chase complete collections.
- **Item Fusion & Crafting:** Players can combine lower-tier items to create higher-tier gear, providing a sense of steady progression even when RNG is unfavorable.
- **On-Chain Ownership:** Select rare items are minted as NFTs, enabling true ownership, tradability, and interoperability across supported platforms.

### **Energy, Resource, and Economy Systems**

To maintain balance and reward active participation, _Archer Hunter_ features a structured in-game economy.

- **Energy/Stamina:** Daily energy caps prevent fatigue-driven grinding while encouraging consistent play. Additional energy can be earned through quests, events, or on-chain achievements.
- **In-Game Currencies:** Players earn soft currency through gameplay for standard upgrades, while premium currency (obtainable via both Web2 purchases and Web3 token utilities) unlocks exclusive items or accelerates progression.
- **Web3 Token Integration:** The native $ARH token is tied to in-game activities, leaderboards, and reward pools, ensuring that skilled and dedicated players benefit from the game’s growth.

### **Dynamic Enemy Scaling and Challenge Curves**

Enemy difficulty scales dynamically based on stage progression, game mode, and player performance, ensuring an optimal balance of tension and reward.

- **Wave Intensification:** Later waves introduce more enemies with synergistic abilities, forcing adaptive strategies.
- **Elite and Boss Encounters:** Special enemy variants with unique attack patterns and higher rewards punctuate gameplay, creating high-stakes moments.
- **Adaptive AI:** In higher difficulty tiers, enemy behaviors evolve based on the player’s chosen upgrades and tactics, preventing static or repetitive encounters.

### **Multiplayer & Cooperative Synergy**

Although _Archer Hunter_ is primarily experienced as a solo action-RPG, select modes and future expansions introduce cooperative mechanics.

- **Team Buffs:** In co-op modes, players can share certain buffs or synergize skill effects for greater impact.
- **Shared Objectives:** Group challenges require coordinated strategies to complete objectives under time pressure.
- **Loot Distribution Mechanics:** Fair and transparent systems ensure cooperative play remains rewarding without fostering player conflict.

### **Web3-Enhanced Mechanics**

_Archer Hunter_ integrates blockchain features in a way that feels natural and enhances — rather than disrupts — the gameplay experience.

- **Proof of Web2 (PoW2):** The system verifies player engagement and achievements in the Web2 version before unlocking Web3-exclusive rewards, ensuring fair participation.
- **Seasonal On-Chain Leaderboards:** Performance-based rankings offer tokenized rewards and exclusive NFTs for top players.
- **Cross-Game Interoperability:** Select heroes and items can be ported into other Nika Labs-supported games, fostering a connected ecosystem.

{% hint style="info" %}
In designing these mechanics, our founding principle has been **player-first game design** — ensuring that _Archer Hunter_ is fun, fair, and rewarding, whether a player ever chooses to engage with its Web3 features or not. By combining precise combat, deep progression, meaningful loot, and thoughtful on-chain integration, we aim to deliver a gameplay loop that can stand alongside the most celebrated action-RPGs in the market.

# On-chain Integrations

From its inception, _Archer Hunter_ has been designed not only as an immersive action RPG experience, but as a **truly Web3-native game,** one in which blockchain technology is not a mere accessory, but a fundamental pillar of gameplay, ownership, and community governance. Our approach to on-chain integrations is deeply intentional: every blockchain-enabled feature exists to **enhance player agency, create sustainable economic systems, and ensure the integrity of digital assets** across the entire game lifecycle.

<details>

<summary><strong>Truly Asset Ownership</strong></summary>

All in-game assets of significance, including characters, weapons, armor, skins, and rare artifacts, are issued as **fully on-chain NFTs**. This ensures:

- **True Ownership:** Once acquired, the asset is stored in the player’s own wallet, with complete transferability and tradability across supported marketplaces.
- **Cross-Game Utility:** Certain assets, especially from limited-time events or collaborations, are designed to be interoperable with partner games within our ecosystem.
- **Verifiable Scarcity:** The supply of legendary and immortal-tier NFTs is enforced at the contract level, preventing inflation or duplication.

To protect both casual and competitive players, we employ **tiered NFT frameworks**, allowing free players to participate without mandatory purchases while still incentivizing upgrades for those seeking competitive advantages or aesthetic prestige.

<summary><strong>On-Chain Progression &#x26; Achievements</strong></summary>

We introduce a system in which key player achievements, milestones, and rankings are immutably recorded on-chain.

- **Ranked Season History:** Player season standings and performance statistics are permanently verifiable.
- **Event Badges:** Special events award unique **Badges** as proof of participation or mastery.
- **Player Reputation Layer:** Future matchmaking, guild recruitment, and tournament eligibility can leverage these on-chain proofs, creating a merit-based progression system.

This design not only rewards commitment but also enables _Archer Hunter_ to become a **credential layer for competitive gaming** within Web3.

<summary><strong>Tokenized Economy</strong></summary>

The _Archer Hunter_ economy is powered by **$ARH**, our native utility token, and designed to integrate seamlessly with our dual-token reward system:

- **$ARH Token:** Used for premium upgrades, governance participation, staking, and entry into exclusive tournaments.
- **In-Game Earned Token:** A secondary reward token earned through gameplay, designed with controlled emission schedules to avoid hyperinflation.

Smart contracts govern every economic interaction, including:

- Asset sales and trades.
- Marketplace fee distribution.
- Reward payouts for PvP tournaments, guild wars, and seasonal leaderboards.
- Token buy-back and burn mechanisms for long-term value sustainability.

<summary><strong>On-Chain Competitive Play</strong></summary>

Competitive integrity is safeguarded through **on-chain tournament orchestration**:

- **Tournament Registration Contracts:** Secure participant entry and verify eligibility.
- **Prize Pool Transparency:** All prize pools are pre-funded and verifiable on-chain prior to event commencement.
- **Match Result Verification:** While core gameplay runs off-chain for performance, match results are submitted, validated, and recorded on-chain for public auditability.

This guarantees that _no manipulation of rankings, payouts, or match results is possible_, fostering trust between players, organizers, and spectators.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Multi-Chain &#x26; Interoperability Strategy</strong></summary>

Although _Archer Hunter_ launches with primary deployment on our chosen mainnet, our contracts and asset standards are designed for **cross-chain interoperability**:

- **Bridging Support:** Assets can be ported to partner blockchains for access to broader marketplaces.
- **Inter-Game Portability:** Select NFTs are compatible with partner titles under the Nika Labs ecosystem.
- **Upgradeable Contracts:** The ability to integrate with future blockchain innovations without fragmenting asset ownership.

This forward-looking approach ensures that _Archer Hunter_ remains adaptable in the rapidly evolving Web3 gaming landscape.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Security &#x26; Anti-Exploitation Measures</strong></summary>

Given the value of on-chain assets and tokenized rewards, _Archer Hunter_ implements **multi-layer security protocols**:

- **Audited Smart Contracts:** All core economic and asset management contracts are independently audited.
- **Bot Detection Mechanisms:** Off-chain monitoring tied to on-chain wallets to flag and suspend exploitative play.
- **Secure Marketplace Architecture:** Direct peer-to-peer trades are protected through escrow-based smart contracts.

Our objective is to **maintain economic fairness** while preserving the freedom and flexibility of player-owned assets.

</details>

**In summary**, on-chain integrations are not merely a feature in _Archer Hunter_, they form the foundation of its **player-first, trustless, and interoperable ecosystem**.
