# Approving Tokens

When you first interact with a new token on DragonSwap, your wallet will request approval for that specific token. This approval process is a fundamental security protocol in crypto transactions, allowing the use of your tokens within the specified smart contract. Before you can execute transactions, it's necessary to approve each token separately.

For example, if a transaction requires USDT and it has not yet been approved, the interface will display "Approve USDT" instead of "Swap”.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/eI_O3lu5BHM8IesR1YyuisgJC2C7JO5d1zTMHYvmKUjUoiB1TKTOKFCsBitVkEZfP7IHi_O1BbngFWGTjYygtNLqqIDxSV2EPydPkDi8klZa94AI8jcs6tpXI_XqRa6ETUN5rZq15kFGlo4vePBxdDQ" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>Approve USDT</em></p></figcaption></figure>

**Changes in Metamask Approvals - March 2023 Update**

In March 2023, Metamask implemented a significant update to its token approval process. Users must now manually set the allowance for each token when authorizing its use with a smart contract. This represents a shift from previous protocols where dApps could specify the required amount or request unlimited token access. For detailed information on Metamask's changes, refer to their official update announcement [here.](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6055177143579-How-to-customize-token-approvals-with-a-spending-cap)

If a user's set allowance in Metamask is lower than the transaction amount on DragonSwap, the transaction may fail. For instance, a transaction will not proceed if a user, having approved an allowance of 1 ETH in Metamask, tries to swap more than that amount on DragonSwap.

Please note that as Metamask continues to update its spending limit features, the screenshots, and guidelines provided by DragonSwap might not always reflect the most current Metamask user interface.

**Approving USDT in Metamask for DragonSwap**

Upon clicking the "Approve" button for a transaction involving USDT, Metamask will display a prompt asking you to define a custom spending cap. The simplest approach is to enter the 'Minimum Allowance' as indicated in the DragonSwap interface, although you have the option to set a higher limit if preferred.

<figure><img src="https://4217001253-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FLh2WlyUUkDbwSy6RELAV%2Fuploads%2Fbzid8fmre6GSoqwxu0zd%2FScreenshot%202024-04-08%20at%2010.22.42.png?alt=media&#x26;token=16707c24-4d6b-4126-b763-2926b14aecfc" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>Set spending cap</em></p></figcaption></figure>

Once you've chosen your limit in Metamask, proceed by clicking 'Next' and then confirm the approval. This will allow you to complete your intended transaction on DragonSwap successfully.

<figure><img src="https://4217001253-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FLh2WlyUUkDbwSy6RELAV%2Fuploads%2FkZJVlvKblNtm5XCmrqLd%2FScreenshot%202024-04-08%20at%2010.23.15.png?alt=media&#x26;token=08db364e-b5bc-47a4-9aee-f2b49cdc9a5e" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>Approve spanding cap</em></p></figcaption></figure>

When approving USDT you have two choices. You can approve the transaction on a one-time basis, or you can opt for permanent approval. The latter means you won't need to approve USDT each time you initiate a swap.

<figure><img src="https://4217001253-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FLh2WlyUUkDbwSy6RELAV%2Fuploads%2FkGXhwjYetsRA2vTGYBEw%2Fimage%20(1).png?alt=media&#x26;token=05c83dd6-9075-48fb-8358-b17eb4101c0b" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>Choose between aprroving on a one-time basis or permanantly</em> </p></figcaption></figure>

That's it! You can now perform a swap on DragonSwap for the approved token.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://4217001253-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FLh2WlyUUkDbwSy6RELAV%2Fuploads%2F2BBuB2Nb3CgmUGhLedOi%2FScreenshot%202024-04-08%20at%2010.23.39.png?alt=media&#x26;token=5b390f01-1400-4601-98df-3764e79eba9c" alt=""><figcaption><p>perfrom the swap</p></figcaption></figure>

**Resetting Approvals in Metamask**

If you need to conduct a transaction on DragonSwap that exceeds a previously set approval limit in Metamask, you will need to reset your approval settings. This can be done using tools like Revoke to view and cancel existing approvals on your wallet. You can then set a new approval limit for the relevant token on DragonSwap.

# Sei V2 EVM

Sei v2 is introduced as the pioneering blockchain that utilizes a parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), marking a substantial evolution from its predecessor. The analysis below unpacks the details.

### Key Features of Sei v2

**Parallelization:**&#x20;

Optimistic parallelization is a feature of Sei v2, enabling developers to perform parallel transactions without defining dependencies. To preserve determinism, conflicting transactions that affect the same state will be replayed consecutively.

**Backward Compatibility:**&#x20;

Sei v2 aims to achieve backward compatibility with Ethereum by smoothly redeploying important Ethereum smart contracts on Sei with no code modifications. Ethereum transaction processing will be possible thanks to the automatic import of Geth by the Sei chain binary.

**Optimized State Storage (SeiDB):**&#x20;

Sei v2 re-architects the storage layer by breaking the IAVL tree into two components: state store and state commitment. The goals of the new storage architecture are to facilitate new node synchronization, decrease state bloat, and enhance read/write performance. PebbleDB will replace GoLevelDB in Sei v2 to increase read/write performance during multi-threaded access.

**Interoperability:**&#x20;

Transactions across different components of Sei (Cosmwasm, EVM, bank, staking) can communicate seamlessly. Different sorts of transactions are processed by Sei native, which creates a more cohesive developer experience.

**Performance Metrics:**&#x20;

Sei v2 supports finality and block times of 390 ms along with 28,300 batched transactions per second. Performance tests conducted in a cluster of twenty nodes show encouraging outcomes for optimistic parallelization with SeiDB.

**Timeline:**&#x20;

The major upgrade is nearly code complete, with audits pending. A public testnet is planned for Q1 2024, and the mainnet deployment is targeted for H1 2024.

### Resulting Effects

**Enhanced Performance:**&#x20;

Sei v2 attempts to offer noticeably better performance characteristics, enabling a higher transaction throughput at a reduced cost per transaction.
\

\
**Developer-Friendly:**&#x20;

More developers will be drawn to Sei v2 because of its backward compatibility and eliminating the requirement for developers to declare state access.
\

\
**Interoperability and Integration:**
&#x20;

Interoperability is improved when transactions involving several components can communicate with one another, giving developers a more fluid experience.
\

\
**EVM Simplified:**
&#x20;

By making the EVM simple again, Sei v2 positions itself as an attractive platform for applications currently built on any EVM chain.
\

\
**Governance Proposal:**&#x20;

The proposal emphasizes community involvement through a governance proposal that will be raised for discussion and voting.

Sei v2 positions itself as a breakthrough in blockchain technology, combining the best aspects of Ethereum and Solana while emphasizing compatibility, speed, and an easier-to-use EVM.&#x20;
