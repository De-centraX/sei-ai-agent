# Understanding Impermanent Loss

## What is Impermanent Loss

When you add liquidity to a liquidity pool and the value of the assets you deposited changes from when you placed them, you may experience an impermanent loss. The magnitude of this alteration increases your susceptibility to transient loss. In this instance, the loss is the difference between the dollar value at the time of deposit and the time of withdrawal.
\

\
Asset pools that stay within a narrow price range will be less at risk of transient losses. For example, various wrapped coins or stablecoins will maintain a pretty small price range. For liquidity providers (LPs), the risk of temporary loss is lower in this scenario.

Given their risk for loss, why do liquidity providers continue to offer liquidity? Well, impermanent loss can still be counteracted by trading fees. Even pools that are quite exposed to impermanent loss can be profitable thanks to the trading fees.&#x20;

If there’s a lot of trading volume happening in a given pool, it can be profitable to provide liquidity even if the pool is heavily exposed to impermanent loss. This, however, depends on the protocol, the specific pool, the deposited assets, and even wider market conditions.

## How to Calculate Impermanent Loss

To calculate IL, the value of the deposited assets in the liquidity pool is comparable to the value of the same assets held in a wallet. To understand this better, consider the example below:
\

\
Suppose Alex wants to offer liquidity to a 50/50 ETH/SEI pool. In this scenario, let’s say Alex deposits 5 ETH and 5,000 SEI (where the price of 1 ETH = 1,000 SEI). If the pool has a total asset value of 100,000 SEI (composed of 50 ETH + 50,000 SEI), the deposit entitles Alex to 10% of the pool share, which Alex can withdraw at any point. But what if the price of one of the assets changes?
\

\
After the liquidity provider has made the initial deposit, the price of 1 ETH doubles and starts trading at 2,000 SEI. Arbitrage traders will add SEI to the pool and remove ETH to make the ETH/SEI price match external exchanges. Liquidity pools rely on algorithms to adjust the pool and manage the assets. The constant product formula is the most basic and widely used formula to calculate IL in scenarios like this. Using this formula, we determine:
\

\
**X \* Y = K**, where X is the amount of token1 and Y is the amount of token2 Based on the formula, initially, we get:
\

\
**50** (ETH) \* **50,000** (SEI) = **2,500,000**
\

\
After the arbitrage trading, we now calculate the new holdings of the pool:
\

\
ETH liquidity = square root (constant product K / new ETH price in SEI)
\

\
**Square root (2,500,000 / 2,000 SEI) = 35.355 ETH**
\

\
SEI liquidity = square root (constant product K \* new ETH price in SEI)
\

\
**Square root (2,500,000 \* 2,000 SEI) = 70,710.678 SEI**
\

\
If Alex withdraws all the tokens at this point, with 10% share in the liquidity pool, a total equivalent to 14,142 SEI (3.5355 ETH \* 2,000 SEI + 7,071 SEI) is received. However, if Alex held the tokens instead, they would be worth 15,000 SEI (5 ETH \* 2,000 SEI + 5,000 SEI).
\

\
In this case, Alex’s IL is **15,000 – 14,142 = 858 SEI**.&#x20;

## Impermanent Loss Calculators

\
IL calculators are available to help estimate the potential loss a user may incur when providing liquidity to a specific pool. They take into account various factors, such as the initial asset prices, the pool composition, and the price changes over time.
\

\
Below are two useful IL calculators:

\

\

\
[GitHub’s Impermanent Loss Calculator](https://impermanentloss.github.io/calculator/)

## Factors Affecting Impermanent Loss

To effectively navigate IL in the cryptocurrency market, there are several key factors a trader might consider:

- One important factor is the liquidity pool's composition. Generally speaking, pools containing stablecoin pairs or assets with strong correlations have lower IL levels. Comprehending the characteristics of the assets in the pool might aid in evaluating the possible hazards associated with it.
- A key factor to keep in mind is the time horizon. Theoretically, IL is only temporary, so if the asset values eventually return to their starting points, the loss may be lessened or perhaps completely removed. Effectively managing information leakage (IL) therefore requires taking into account the length of time assets are held in pools as well as the possibility that the assets will revert to their original values.
- It is essential to stay updated with the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market. The possible risks and benefits connected with IL may be greatly impacted by the addition of new assets or changes to the market. Reduce the impact of IL by closely monitoring market movements and modifying strategies as necessary.

# V2: Concentrated Liquidity Pools

DragonSwap V2 brings Concentrated Liquidity Pools to the platform. This upgrade is designed to significantly improve capital efficiency for liquidity providers (LPs) by allowing them to focus their liquidity within specific price ranges. By concentrating liquidity in these key ranges, LPs can achieve deeper liquidity, reduce slippage, and potentially earn higher returns on their investments.

### The Benefits of Concentrated Liquidity&#x20;

Concentrated liquidity offers LPs more control over how their capital is allocated, focusing it within the price ranges where trading activity is most likely to occur. This is a significant departure from traditional liquidity pools, where capital is spread across the entire price range, including areas with little to no activity. By concentrating liquidity, LPs can optimize their positions, ensuring that their capital is actively contributing to deeper liquidity and more efficient trading.

One of the key advantages of this model is that LPs can achieve higher capital efficiency, meaning they can provide the same level of liquidity with less capital, or generate higher returns with the same amount of capital. The concentrated nature of this approach allows every unit of capital to work harder within the price ranges where it matters most.

### Overview of the V2-Staker&#x20;

DragonSwap V2 introduces the V2-Staker, a tool designed to distribute liquid rewards to optimize LP APR. The V2-Staker allows LPs to stake their liquidity positions, represented by NFTs, in specific pools to earn additional rewards.

**How It Works:**

1. **Provide Liquidity:** LPs supply liquidity to a trading pair on DragonSwap and receive an NFT representing their position.
2. **Stake the NFT:** This NFT can then be staked in a liquidity mining contract. The contract tracks the staked liquidity and calculates rewards based on the size of the position.
3. **Earn Rewards:** LPs earn additional tokens as rewards, determined by the amount of liquidity staked and the pool’s performance.

The V2-Staker is designed to maximize the potential returns for LPs, allowing them to generate additional rewards while maintaining control over their concentrated liquidity positions.

### LP vs. Staked Positions

- **LP Position:** This refers to the liquidity provided to a trading pair within a chosen price range. This liquidity is represented by an NFT, which allows LPs to earn trading fees based on activity within the price range they have chosen.
- **Staked Position:** A staked position involves locking a single position into a staking contract. When LPs stake their positions they can unlock additional rewards on top of the standard trading fees.

### How CL Rewards Work

In CL pools, managing rewards is straightforward, but there’s a key point to remember- swap fees aren’t claimable while your position is staked. To claim them, you need to unstake your position first. Once unstaked, you can access your earned fees.

For V2 positions with staked NFTs, your LP rewards continue to accrue but can only be claimed after unstaking. The process is simple: unstake, claim your rewards, and re-stake to continue earning. LP rewards continue to accumulate while staked, with only a brief 15-second window required for the unstake-claim-restake process.

**Why Aren’t Fees Visible While Staked?**

Fees aren’t visible during staking because your position is reallocated when you move DS tokens (or in this case the NFT) into a farm. Similar to xyk pools, the position will reappear once you unstake from the farm.

# Automated Liquidity Managers (ALM)

DragonSwap has integrated automated liquidity management such as Steer Protocol, directly into our UI. This feature allows users to provide liquidity to select concentrated liquidity (CL) pools, also known as smart pools, without the need for active position management.

### **How Auto Liquidity Works**

Unlike standard CL positions, auto liquidity operates through strategies rather than individual positions. Here’s what you need to know:

- No Traditional Positions - Auto liquidity doesn’t rely on standard CL positions. Instead, deposits are managed through strategies (also called vaults), which optimize liquidity based on predefined parameters.
- Strategy-Based Pools -  Supported pools operate through strategies rather than manual position placement. These strategies function similarly to traditional DragonSwap V1 pools.
- LP Tokens Represent Your Share -  When you deposit into a strategy, you receive an LP token representing your share of the pool.
- Withdrawals Work Differently — When withdrawing, you return your LP token in exchange for your corresponding percentage of the pool’s assets. This process is handled through the strategy’s dedicated withdrawal modal.

### Where to View Your Auto Liquidity Deposits

Since auto liquidity positions don’t function like standard CL positions, their visibility in the UI is different.  After depositing into a strategy, the related pools will appear in the “My Pools” tab on the Pools page. Unlike traditional positions, auto liquidity deposits won’t appear under the Manage Liquidity section on a single pool page since they aren’t considered individual positions.&#x20;

### Why Use Auto Liquidity?

Auto liquidity strategies simplify LPing by removing the need for active management. Instead of manually adjusting positions as the market moves, you can choose a strategy and let automation handle it for you.&#x20;
