# Token & Tokenomics

- DragonSwap's native token is $DRG.
- CA: 0x0a526e425809aEA71eb279d24ae22Dee6C92A4Fe

## $DRG Utility <a href="#d013" id="d013"></a>

$DRG puts real utility into the hands of its holders, giving real power to our users. It’s a core part of how DragonSwap will grow.

At launch, users will be able to stake DRG to receive sDRG, a staked version of the token that opens deeper participation in the protocol.

Staking sDRG gives users access to:

- **Protocol Emissions-** A share of ongoing rewards
- **Governance-** The ability to vote on protocol parameters and incentive direction
- **Protocol Fees-** Select protocol fees may be routed back to stakers via emission-based rewards
- **Future Utility-** Access to token launches, airdrops, and other exclusive features tied to DragonSwap’s ecosystem roadmap

## Distribution Breakdown <a href="#fdf3" id="fdf3"></a>

75% of the total supply is allocated directly to community and ecosystem growth. The goal is simple: give the protocol to those who use it and grow it. Below, you’ll find a full breakdown of $DRG’s allocation, including vesting schedules, cliffs, and unlock timelines. No oversized insider allocations, no public sale, only transparent, long-term alignment.

## Vesting <a href="#de09" id="de09"></a>

**Angel Round**: 10% at TGE, 4M cliff, 18M vesting\
**Seed Round**: 10% at TGE, 6M cliff, 12M Vesting\
**Ecosystem:** 5% at TGE, 0M cliff, 36M vesting\
**Team:** 0% TGE, 9M cliff, 36M vesting\
**Liquidity:** 100% at TGE\
**Community:** 1% at TGE, 0M cliff, 24M vesting

## How We Got Here <a href="#id-52df" id="id-52df"></a>

When we were designing tokenomics for DragonSwap, we deeply debated emissions, market depth, dilution, sustainability, and how to strike a balance between driving growth and preserving value.

We opted for:

- Deep ecosystem reserves (40%) with long-term unlocks
- Heavy community allocation (30%)
- Locked contributor and advisor allocations (9–36 months)
- No public sale, no IDO to ensure community-aligned participation

## TL;DR <a href="#id-7dbe" id="id-7dbe"></a>

- 1B total supply
- 75% allocated to the community, contributors, and ecosystem
- DEX launch with $15M FDV
- No public sale, No IDO
- Fully liquid LP and MM funds at launch

# DragonswapV1

## Overview

DragonswapV1 is a binary smart contract system. [Core](#core) contracts provide fundamental safety guarantees for all parties interacting with Dragonswap. [Periphery](#periphery) contracts interact with one or more core contracts but are not themselves part of the core.

## Core

[Source code](https://github.com/dragonswap-app/dragonswap-core)

The core consists of a singleton [factory](#factory) and many [pairs](#pairs), which the factory is responsible for creating and indexing. These contracts are quite minimal, even brutalist. The simple rationale for this is that contracts with a smaller surface area are easier to reason about, less bug-prone, and more functionally elegant. Perhaps the biggest upside of this design is that many desired properties of the system can be asserted directly in the code, leaving little room for error. One downside, however, is that core contracts are somewhat user-unfriendly. In fact, interacting directly with these contracts is not recommended for most use cases. Instead, a periphery contract should be used.

### Factory[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/smart-contracts#factory) <a href="#factory" id="factory"></a>

[Reference documentation](dragonswapv1/factory)

The factory holds the generic bytecode responsible for powering pairs. Its primary job is to create one and only one smart contract per unique token pair. It also contains logic to turn on the protocol charge.

### Pairs[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/smart-contracts#pairs) <a href="#pairs" id="pairs"></a>

[Reference documentation](dragonswapv1/pair)

[Reference documentation (ERC-20)](dragonswapv1/pair-erc-20)

Pairs have two primary purposes: serving as automated market makers and keeping track of pool token balances. They also expose data which can be used to build decentralized price oracles.

## Periphery

[Source code](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery)

The periphery is a constellation of smart contracts designed to support domain-specific interactions with the core. Because of Dragonswap's permissionless nature, the contracts described below have no special privileges, and are in fact only a small subset of the universe of possible periphery-like contracts. However, they are useful examples of how to safely and efficiently interact with Dragonswap.

### Library[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/smart-contracts#library) <a href="#library" id="library"></a>

[Reference documentation](dragonswapv1/library)

The library provides a variety of convenience functions for fetching data and pricing.

### Router[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/smart-contracts#router) <a href="#router" id="router"></a>

[Reference documentation](dragonswapv1/router)

The router, which uses the library, fully supports all the basic requirements of a front-end offering trading and liquidity management functionality. Notably, it natively supports multi-pair trades (e.g. x to y to z), treats SEI as a first-class citizen, and offers meta-transactions for removing liquidity.

## Design Decisions

The following sections describe some of the notable design decisions made in Dragonswap. These are safe to skip unless you're interested in gaining a deep technical understanding of how Dragonswap works under the hood, or writing smart contract integrations!

### Sending Tokens[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/smart-contracts#sending-tokens) <a href="#sending-tokens" id="sending-tokens"></a>

Typically, smart contracts which need tokens to perform some functionality require would-be interactors to first make an approval on the token contract, then call a function that in turn calls transferFrom on the token contract. This is _not_ how Dragonswap pairs accept tokens. Instead, pairs check their token balances at the _end_ of every interaction. Then, at the beginning of the _next_ interaction, current balances are differenced against the stored values to determine the amount of tokens that were sent by the current interactor. See the [whitepaper](https://docs.uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf) for a justification of why this is the case, but the takeaway is that **tokens must be transferred to the pair before calling any token-requiring method** (the one exception to this rule is [Flash Swaps](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/core-concepts/flash-swaps).

### WSEI[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/smart-contracts#weth) <a href="#weth" id="weth"></a>

Dragonswap pairs do not support SEI directly, so SEI⇄ERC-20 pairs must be emulated with WSEI. The motivation behind this choice was to remove SEI-specific code in the core, resulting in a leaner codebase. End users can be kept fully ignorant of this implementation detail, however, by simply wrapping/unwrapping SEI in the periphery.

The router fully supports interacting with any WSEI pair via SEI.

### Minimum Liquidity[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/protocol-overview/smart-contracts#minimum-liquidity) <a href="#minimum-liquidity" id="minimum-liquidity"></a>

To ameliorate rounding errors and increase the theoretical minimum tick size for liquidity provision, pairs burn the first [MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/reference/smart-contracts/pair#minimum_liquidity) pool tokens. For the vast majority of pairs, this will represent a trivial value. The burning happens automatically during the first liquidity provision, after which point the [totalSupply](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/reference/smart-contracts/pair-erc-20#totalsupply) is forevermore bounded.

# DragonswapV2

## Overview

DragonswapV2 is a binary smart contract system comprised of many libraries, which together make the Core and Periphery.

Core contracts provide fundamental safety guarantees for all parties interacting with Dragonswap. They define the logic of pool generation, the pools themselves, and the interactions involving the respective assets therein.

Periphery contracts interact with one or more Core contracts but are not part of the core. They are designed to provide methods of interacting with the core that increase clarity and user safety.

External calls will primarily call the periphery interfaces. Externally available functions are all viewable in the reference documentation. Internal functions are viewable on the DragonswapV2 Github repo.

### Core[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/overview#core) <a href="#core" id="core"></a>

The core consists of a single factory, a pool deployer, and the many pools the factory will create.

A significant amount of care and attention has been given to gas optimization in the core contracts. The result is a substantial reduction in gas costs for all protocol interactions compared to DragonswapV1, at the cost of a reduction in code clarity.

#### Factory[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/overview#factory) <a href="#factory" id="factory"></a>

The factory defines the logic for generating pools. A pool is defined by two tokens, which make up the asset pair, and a fee. There can be multiple pools of the same asset pair, distinguished only by their swap fee.

#### Pools[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/overview#pools) <a href="#pools" id="pools"></a>

Pools primarily serve as automated market makers for the paired assets. Additionally, they expose price oracle data and may be used as an asset source for flash transactions.

### Periphery[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/overview#periphery) <a href="#periphery" id="periphery"></a>

The periphery is a constellation of smart contracts designed to support domain-specific interactions with the core. As the Dragonswap protocol is a permissionless system, the contracts described below have no special privileges and are only a small subset of possible periphery-like contracts.

#### SwapRouter[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/overview#swaprouter) <a href="#swaprouter" id="swaprouter"></a>

The swap router supports all the basic requirements of a front-end offering trading. It natively supports single trades (x to y) and multihop trades (e.g. x to y to z).

#### Nonfungible Position Manager[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/overview#nonfungible-position-manager) <a href="#nonfungible-position-manager" id="nonfungible-position-manager"></a>

The position manager handles the logic transactions involving the creation, adjustment, or exiting of positions.

#### Oracle[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/overview#oracle) <a href="#oracle" id="oracle"></a>

The oracle provides price and liquidity data useful for a wide variety of system designs, and is available in every deployed pool.

#### Periphery Libraries[​](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/overview#periphery-libraries) <a href="#periphery-libraries" id="periphery-libraries"></a>

The libraries provide a variety of helper functions developers may need, like calculating pool addresses, safe transfer functions, and more.
