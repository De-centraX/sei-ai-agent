# What is Oxium?

Oxium is an order book DEX that allows liquidity providers to post arbitrary smart contracts (hooks) as offers. This enables features such as re-staking of liquidity held on other protocols, liquidity amplification and liquidity provision via custom strategies.

## Unlock your liquidity‚Äã

Oxium's order book DEX lists promises instead of locked commitments (liquidity is not locked on Oxium). It can be employed elsewhere until the offer is matched. For example, you can provide liquidity (LP) on another exchange and use this LPed liquidity on Oxium at the same time to trade or run strategies. This way, you can earn from up to any sources of yields, spread and rewards.

# Smart offers

The main difference between Oxium and other DEXs is the ability to attach code to offers (check out Smart Offers for more information). This translates into several disruptive mechanisms:

- **Reactive liquidity**\
  The liquidity on offer on Oxium **is not locked in a pool**. As long as an offer posted on Oxium is not taken, it can generate yield elsewhere on the chain - Aave, Compound or Morpho are great examples of protocols where you could leave your liquidity to grow, waiting to be sourced.
- **Last look** \
  Since an offer contains code, **defensive mechanisms can be baked in** to cancel a promise previously made:
  - For instance, if the market conditions are not anymore satisfactory at the time the offer is taken VS when it was posted
  - Code can cover any unwanted case scenarios (ex: high volatility), and therefore can mitigate/solve problems of slippage and arbitrage
  - Code helps make zero-latency trading decisions, with as much information as available on-chain at the time the trade occurs
- **Persistence** \
  Through the executed code, the **offer can automatically repost itself** on the order book. For someone who is posting offers (we call them Makers, or Market Makers), this is very handy because they can immediately update the amount of tokens they are offering after some of it has been taken. People that take offers are called Takers.

Smart contracts can be attached to offers, which gives the Maker total freedom in setting his sourcing trade parameters.

**Other powerful applications of smart offers**[**‚Äã**](https://docs.mangrove.exchange/#powerful-applications-of-smart-offers)**:**

- **Bounty:** every single failed offer is compensated with a bounty; Keeper bots can make money, and Takers don't lose any.
- **Permissionless:** everyone can interact with the core protocol without having to ask permission nor risking to be censored.
- **Non-custodial:** Oxium users retain full control over their funds - the exchange does not hold custody of their assets.

# Bounty

What if everyone makes empty promises, and the offers in the book are all meant to fail? This is where Makers **must leave a native token provision (the bounty)** in their offer. Nothing prevents them from posting offers that will always fail. So, to ensure that the offers displayed on the book are credible, it must be costly for Makers to post orders that are not meant to go through. And in that case scenario, the bounty is then given to the Taker as compensation.&#x20;

At first, **this might appear to favor Makers**. However, with advanced market-making features that allow them to accept or cancel offers, **Makers can mitigate their risk** and offer better prices. Ultimately, both Makers and Takers benefit: the risk of offer failure is essential for the effectiveness of smart offers.

Let's spend more time understanding [Makers](/oxium-1/start-here/what-is-oxium/makers-takers-keepers/makers), [Takers](/oxium-1/start-here/what-is-oxium/makers-takers-keepers/takers), and [Keepers ](/oxium-1/start-here/what-is-oxium/makers-takers-keepers/keepers)(yes, that last one is a new term), shall we?

# Makers, Takers, Keepers

In the Oxium ecosystem, three key participants interact to facilitate a dynamic and decentralized trading environment: [Makers](/oxium-1/start-here/what-is-oxium/makers-takers-keepers/makers), [Takers](/oxium-1/start-here/what-is-oxium/makers-takers-keepers/takers), and [Keepers](/oxium-1/start-here/what-is-oxium/makers-takers-keepers/keepers). Together, they form the backbone of the Oxium ecosystem, each playing a unique yet interconnected role in ensuring a seamless and effective trading experience.

Here is a simplified three-step diagram of Oxium unlocked assets and offer-is-code approach. It also introduces the three main actors on Oxium DEX.

# Makers

Makers are participants or entities within the Oxium ecosystem who are responsible for creating and listing offers on the platform. They can specify the conditions of their offers, such as the type and quantity of assets to be exchanged, the price, and any other relevant terms. For example, they promise to give a Taker some apples üçé if he gives them oranges üçä in return.

By initiating these offers, Makers enable transactions to occur within the Oxium Protocol, contributing to a vibrant market.

# Takers

**Takers** respond to the offers set up by [Makers](/oxium-1/start-here/what-is-oxium/makers-takers-keepers/makers). They critically assess these offers, considering factors like asset types, quantities, and prices.

The role of Takers is crucial in completing transactions within the Oxium marketplace. When a Taker agrees to the terms of an offer, they effectively seals the deal proposed by the Maker, leading to the execution of the trade.

Takers provide the necessary demand and liquidity in the marketplace, ensuring that the offers created by Makers are fulfilled. Their actions complete the cycle of trading activity within the Oxium ecosystem, making it a dynamic and interactive platform for exchanges.

Takers have the ability to buy or sell assets on Oxium, using either market or limit orders, akin to a traditional orderbook. They can execute these offers through general orders or choose to clean them individually.

This interaction between Takers and Makers completes the trading cycle in the Oxium ecosystem, enhancing its interactivity and liquidity.

The workflow for Takers involves executing the logic of all relevant smart offers upon an order's placement. Successful orders are removed from the book, and the process continues until the Taker's order is completely filled. If a Maker withdraws their offer and fails to match the liquidity, the Taker is compensated with a penalty (bounty), and Oxium proceeds to the next offer. This ensures that Takers are appropriately remunerated and that the order book remains efficient.

# Keepers

Keepers functioning as automated bots that ensure the order book remains relevant and efficient. As market conditions evolve, the order book may become congested with outdated or irrelevant orders. Keepers play a pivotal role in addressing this by continuously monitoring the order book.

Their primary responsibility is to identify offers that are failing. Once a failing offer is detected, Keepers targets them to clean them off the book. This action involves setting a gas price in such a way that the offer‚Äôs bounty offsets the gas expenditure. Essentially, Keepers act as the custodians of the Oxium ecosystem, maintaining its integrity and smooth operation.

In addition to managing failing offers, Keepers are tasked with keeping the gas price up to date. This is crucial for determining the compensation for [Takers ](/oxium-1/start-here/what-is-oxium/makers-takers-keepers/takers)who remove a failing offer from the list. By doing so, Keepers ensure that Takers are appropriately remunerated for their role in sustaining the efficiency and cleanliness of the order book.

Through these functions, Keepers play an indispensable role in the maintenance and operational effectiveness of the Oxium ecosystem, safeguarding its functionality and reliability.

# FAQ

<details>

<summary>Why do my transactions keep failing?‚Äã</summary>

Here are a few reasons as to why your transactions are failing on Oxium exchange:

- The amount of gas or slippage you selected is too low - we encourage you to tweak those values and find out what works best for your trades.
- The density for your Limit order is too low - if you're trying to place a Limit order with a small amount, your order will fail and will not be executed. Oxium requires that you provide a token amount greater than the amount of gas the triggered offer requires to be executed (called density).
- You can check the minimum volume required to post a limit order [here](/oxium-1/dapp-guide/trade/how-to-make-an-order/limit-order).

</details>

<details>

<summary>The approval amount for my limit orders seems odd - what is going on?‚Äã</summary>

**TL;DR**

- A rule of thumb for limit orders to avoid order failure due to lack of approval is to make sure you approve at least double the amount you target (or infinite approval).
- The easy way to do this is to use the "Use default" option on your wallet when executing an approval.

**Let's now clarify the difference between the "Max" and "Use default" approval values offered by your wallet.**

- "Max" will give you the maximum amount available in your wallet.
- If you have ticked the "allow infinite approval" on Oxium app, "Use default" will give you an "infinite approval" amount.
- If you have unticked the "allow infinite approval" on Oxium app, "Use default" will give you the maximum amount available in your wallet based on what you've keyed in. That amount differs **whether you are executing a market order or a limit order**.

**Example (no infinite approval)**

- Market order: if you want to buy some WETH with let's say 20 USDC, "Use default" will set the approval amount at _20 + slippage_. For a 2% slippage, the amount to approve would be 20.4 USDC.
- Limit order: if you want to buy some WETH for 20 USDC of worth with a limit order (ex: Good til time), "Use default" will set the approval amount at _40 (20 \* 2)_.
  - If you have multiple open limit orders for the same token, the approvals then need to compound.
  - Example: if you create another Good til time limit order for 20 USDC of worth, the approval amount will be 40 (previous limit order) + 40 (new limit order) = 80 USDC.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Where is my transaction history?‚Äã</summary>

Which order type are you trying to execute? There are subtle differences between the various limit orders available on our Trade page. They might appear/be processed differently. We encourage you to first read the [More on order types](/oxium-1/dapp-guide/trade/how-to-make-an-order/more-on-order-types) section.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Who pays the gas on Oxium?‚Äã</summary>

If the offer succeeds, the gas costs for the execution of the trade are paid by the offer taker. If the offer fails the taker is compensated for these gas costs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens when an offer fails?‚Äã</summary>

Offers in the order book may fail when taken, either because the maker consciously chose to renege on the offer to trade, or because the maker contract reverted for other reasons. In that case, the taker has wasted some gas and will be compensated using the offer provision (in native token) that the maker has deposited in Oxium.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are Oxium market orders the same as traditional market orders?‚Äã</summary>

Oxium's market orders are DeFi market orders - which are different from market orders in TradFi:

In TradFi, a market order is an order to buy or sell immediately at the best available price.

In DeFi, where transactions can be [front-run](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp) or [sandwiched](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-sandwich-attacks-in-defi-and-how-can-you-avoid-them), adversaries may manipulate the best available price and thus extract value from a market order as there is no limit on the price. TradFi market orders are therefore unsafe for fully on-chain DEX'es like Oxium.

To protect the user, Oxium's market order therefore corresponds to a [**limit order**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) in TradFi: An order to buy or sell at or below a given price. More precisely, Oxium ensures that the **average** price of the offers matched with the order does not exceed the specified price.

TL;DR: Oxium market order = TradFi limit order.

# Swap

With Oxium‚Äôs swap page, you can swap tokens quickly and seamlessly. This feature allows you to execute market orders with ease, ensuring that you get the best available price without the hassle of complicated configurations.

#### **Step 1: Connect Your Wallet**

Click the **"Connect Wallet"** button at the bottom of the swap interface. This will open a pop-up for selecting and authorizing your wallet, allowing it to interact with Oxium‚Äôs DApp on the chosen network.

**Disconnecting Your Wallet**: To disconnect your wallet, click on your wallet address in the top right corner. This will bring up a small pop-up with options to **Copy Address** and **Disconnect**. Click **Disconnect** to securely log out your wallet from the DApp.

<figure><img src="https://2719346828-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fpeljr67Or3TDyhxkyIv3%2Fuploads%2FdDcP0EmtfFitU9bmphQ4%2FCapture%20d%E2%80%99e%CC%81cran%202025-05-20%20a%CC%80%2013.44.56.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1176c3fb-09f8-45d1-bfd4-074ad240c626" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### **Step 2: Select Tokens for Swapping**

- With your wallet connected and network set, proceed with choosing the tokens for the swap.
- **Sell** and **Buy Sections**: The swap interface is divided into two main sections:
  - **Sell**: The token you‚Äôre offering in the swap.
  - **Buy**: The token you‚Äôll receive in exchange.

1. **Token Selection**: Click the dropdown next to each token icon to select the token type. The available options may vary depending on the selected network.
2. **Enter Amount**:
   - **Sell Amount**: Enter the amount of the token you want to swap in the **Sell** field. An equivalent USD value is displayed below for reference.
   - **Buy Amount**: After entering the sell amount, the buy amount will auto-calculate based on the current market rate.

If you wish to reverse the **Sell** and **Buy** tokens, you can click **Swap Direction** button (‚Üî) between the Sell and Buy sections to reverse the tokens and quickly switch the trade direction. This will instantly switch the tokens, making the **Buy** token the **Sell** token, and vice versa, without needing to re-enter amounts.

**Note**: If the swap amount exceeds your balance, an **"Insufficient Balance"** message will appear. Make sure you have enough tokens to proceed.

#### **Step 3: Set Slippage Tolerance**

This controls the maximum price variation you‚Äôre willing to accept for the trade.

- **Available Options**: Choose from 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, or set a **custom percentage**.
- **Use Case**: A lower tolerance limits price variation but may cause failed transactions if prices move. Higher tolerance increases the success rate but allows for more price fluctuation.
